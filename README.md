Learnify
    Learnify is an educational platform designed to provide an engaging and seamless learning experience. It serves as a marketplace where instructors can share their expertise and students can enhance their knowledge by enrolling in courses. The platform ensures quality and trust through a robust verification process and administrative oversight.
The system includes three main user roles: Admin, Instructors, and Students. The Admin has the authority to verify instructors and students upon registration, approve or reject courses submitted by instructors, and perform various administrative tasks such as generating reports. Instructors can register on the platform, create courses with detailed descriptions and video content, and manage their profile. All instructor actions, such as course creation, require admin approval. Students can register, browse the available courses, enroll, watch course videos, and download a certificate upon successful completion.
The application is structured to manage various entities like user authentication, instructor profiles, student details, courses, enrollments, and certificates. Courses are verified by the admin to ensure quality, and students receive certificates automatically upon completing the course content. Additionally, the admin can generate reports that track key metrics such as enrollments, revenue, and course completion rates.
Technologically, Learnify is built using Python and Django for the backend, with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for the frontend. The database, by default, is SQLite, though it supports other databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL. Media content, such as course videos and certificates, is efficiently handled using Django's file storage system.
